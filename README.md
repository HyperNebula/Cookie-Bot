# How to use the Discord Cookie-Bot

This is a money discord bot, made using python. In order to use it, you must have **python 3.6** or higher installed, and the python modules **discord.py** and **pandas**. If you want the *definition* command to work, you will need the **Wikipedia** module installed. If you don't have it the bot will still work, that command will just not work. In order to run the bot, make sure that all the files are in the same location, and then run the python file ***CookieBotV3.py***. As long as the file is open, the bot will run.

I have added a python script to simplify adding the Bot token and id. To add them, just run ***setup.py*** and fill in the information when asked. There is also the option to add a custom prefix. If you do not supply one, the default prefix is **"/"**

For a more detail instructions on how to use and setup the bot, visit the [Wiki v3.1](https://github.com/HyperNebula/Cookie-Bot/wiki/Installation-for-v3)
