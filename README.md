# How to use the Discord Cookie-Bot

# This is a beta version of the bot. It may not work!

This is a money discord bot, made using python. In order to use it, you must have **python3.6** or higher installed, and the python modules **discord.py** and **pandas**. In order to run it, make sure that all the files are in the same location, and then run the python file. As long as the file is open, the bot will run.

You must also make a discord bot applictation on their website and replace ***YourTokenHere*** at the bottem of the python file with your bot token. If you want a channel for logs of all messages edited and deleted, replace ***Channel_Id*** with the target Channel Id.
