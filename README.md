# How to use the Discord Cookie-Bot

This is a money discord bot, made using python. In order to use it, you must have **python 3.6** or higher installed, and the python modules **discord.py** and **pandas**. If you want the *definition* command to work, you will need the **Wikipedia** module installed. If you don't have it the bot will still work, that command will just not work. In order to run the bot, make sure that all the files are in the same location, and then run the python file ***CookieBotV3.py***. As long as the file is open, the bot will run.

I have added a python script to simplify adding the Bot token and id. To add them, just run ***setup.py*** and fill in the information when asked. There is also the option to add a custom prefix. If you do not supply one, the default prefix is **"/"**

### NOTE: As of right now, python 3.7 does not work with the bot. Please use python 3.6. This bot also only works with versions of discord.py before v1.0 right now

I am currently working on updating the bot to the latest version of discord.py

If you want to use the last working version, use this: [Version 3.0](https://github.com/HyperNebula/Cookie-Bot/releases/download/v3.0/v3.0-PythonFiles.zip)
