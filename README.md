I have added a python script to simplify adding the Bot token and id. To add them, just run ***setup.py*** and fill in the information when asked. There is also the option to add a custom prefix. If you do not supply one, the default prefix is **"/"**

If you want to use the last working version, use this: [Version 3.1](https://github.com/HyperNebula/Cookie-Bot/releases/download/v3.0/v3.0-PythonFiles.zip)
